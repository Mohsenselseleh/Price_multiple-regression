This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages('FNN')
install.packages('RCurl')
install.packages('MASS')
install.packages('leaps')
library(MASS) # stepwise regression
library(leaps) # all subsets regression
```


Dataset: http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Computers.csv
1. Create a multiple linear regression model to predict price.
(a) Split the dataset to 70% of training and 30% of test sets.

```{r}
getwd()
Computer_s <- read.csv(file="Computers.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
Computer_s
```



```{r}
rn_train <- sample(nrow(Computer_s), floor(nrow(Computer_s)*0.7))
train <- Computer_s[rn_train,]
test <- Computer_s[-rn_train,]
```


(b) Create a multiple linear regression model on the training set using ram, screen,
speed, hd and ads as independent variables.


```{r}
model_mlr <- lm(price~ram+speed+screen+hd+ads, data=train)
model_mlr
```
(c) Apply predict() function on the test set.
```{r}
prediction <- predict(model_mlr, interval="prediction",newdata =test)

```
(d) Calculate the errors (prediction price â€“ test price) in predictions and show the
histogram of errors.
```{r}
errors <- prediction[,"fit"] - test$price
hist(errors)
```

(e) Compute the root mean squared errors.


```{r}
rmse <- sqrt(sum((prediction[,"fit"]-test$price)^2)/nrow(test))
rmse
```
2. Apply forward selection and backward elimination algorithms to the dataset.
```{r}
full <- lm(price~ram+hd+speed+screen+ads+trend,data=train)
null <- lm(price~1,data=train)
stepF <- stepAIC(null, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full),direction= "forward", trace=TRUE)
summary(stepF)
```

Backward elimination:
```{r}
full <- lm(price~ram+hd+speed+screen+ads+trend,data=train)
stepB <- stepAIC(full, direction= "backward", trace=TRUE)
summary(stepB)

```
3. Apply regsubsets() to see the best combination of the attributes.
```{r}
subsets<-regsubsets(price~ram+hd+speed+screen+ads+trend,data=train, nbest=1)
sub.sum <- summary(subsets)
as.data.frame(sub.sum$outmat)

```
In the output, * denotes the variables included to the subset. For example,
the best combination of 4 attributes is: ram, speed, screen and trend, and
the best combination of 5 attributes is: ram, hd, speed, screen and trend.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
